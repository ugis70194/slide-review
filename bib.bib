  abstract = {This study examined the impact of an artificial intelligence (AI)-supported approach to peer feedback provision on the feedback quality and writing ability of English as a foreign language (EFL) student reviewers. The researchers integrated an AI chatbot named Eva into an online peer review system to assist students in generating feedback. A total of 124 Chinese undergraduate students participated in nine peer review tasks over three weeks, with 64 students in the experimental group (using Eva) and 60 students in the control group (without AI support). Pre- and post-tests were conducted to assess the quality of student reviewers' peer feedback and these feedback providers' writing performance before and after the intervention. The findings revealed that the intervention significantly enhanced students' feedback quality. Additionally, the study showed that the proposed approach improved feedback providers' writing ability. This research underscores the potential of AI technology in enhancing EFL writing instruction.}

  abstract = {Teachers often complain about the quality of students' written essays in higher education. This study explores the relations between scripted online peer feedback processes and quality of written argumentative essay as they occur in an authentic learning situation with direct practical relevance. Furthermore, the effects of the online argumentative peer feedback script on students' written argumentative essay are studied. A pre-test, post-test design was used with 189 undergraduate students who were assigned to groups of three. They were asked to explore various perspectives, and the ‘pros and cons’ on the topic of ‘Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)’ in order to write an argumentative essay in the field of biotechnology. The findings reveal that successful students and groups differ in terms of their feedback quality than less-successful students and groups. This implies that when students engage in high-quality, elaborated and justified peer feedback processes, they write high-quality argumentative essays. Furthermore, the results show that the online argumentative peer feedback script enhances the quality of students' written argumentative essay. Explanations for these results, limitations, and recommendations for further research are provided.}

abstract = {Across disciplines and educational levels, peer feedback has emerged as a broadly useful pedagogical strategy. However, the value of peer feedback depends upon students being willing to provide each other substantial feedback. We develop a novel application of game theory to study whether students’ experiences with interaction inequality in peer feedback predict lower participation in future peer feedback assignments. Two kinds of inequality are explored: inequality in amount and inequality in the helpfulness of received vs. providing feedback. We examine data from students (N = 732) enrolled in the three different courses (varying in discipline and level) using the same online peer review platform. We use advanced multiple regression models to test four theoretically-derived hypotheses regarding the overall effects of experienced inequality, three hypotheses involving contextual moderators of that effect. The results confirmed the hypothesized relationship of experiencing inequality in the number and quality of feedback provided vs. received with the subsequent depth of participation in peer reviewing. The results also generally confirmed the three predicted moderators of the relationship: stronger observed relationships with inequality experiences for weaker students, in later assignments, and in more advanced coursework. This study is unique in applying and extending game theory to computerized peer review and in its approach for studying the relationship of specific prior experiences with future peer review participation. The findings provide new practical insights into what is essential to manage in peer review processes.}
